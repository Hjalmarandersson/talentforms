# Talentforms

  <p>
Talenforms was an CRUD app where companies(users) could create an page for their company and then add/uppdate/delete job openings that candidates could apply to. Talentforms is not online anymore. To get Talentforms to work locally again, changes to Firebase-code is needed due to deprecated functions in Firebase library.
